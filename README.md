# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview

This technical analysis is being done to help Bobby determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help Bobby’s manager to plan for how many of his employees are reaching retirement age and therefore, how many job positions will become available that need to be filled. 

##Results

•	90,398 people are set to retire soon (unique_titles.csv)

•	Employees with title “Senior Engineers” has the highest amount retiring at a high of 29,414 (retiring_titles.csv)

•	Management has the lowest amount of retiring at a low of 2 (retiring_titles.csv)

•	Out of the two managers retiring, neither are eligible to become mentors for mentorship program (mentorship_eligibility.csv)

##Summary
When the “Silver Tsunami” starts making an impact, Pewlett Hackard will have 90,398 openings they will have to fill. That is a very large number of openings for a company. In reference to the mentorship_eligibility query, I’m seeing less than 2000 employees will be available to participate in the mentorship program. With the large amount of openings, I’d suggest opening up the mentorship program to employees with a lot of experience and not just based off of age.
